My main motivation for this blog is to force myself write down the interesting ideas and learnings that I come across. My day job is as a software engineer. Since I graduated college, I haven't worked on any meaningful side projects. For the last couple of years, I've been wanting to create a "minimal" exercise-tracking app tailored for my own workouts, but never got around to do it. Maybe I'll start now.
